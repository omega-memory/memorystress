abstract: >-
  MemoryStress is a longitudinal benchmark for evaluating AI agent memory
  systems, LLM memory retention, and RAG pipeline degradation across 1,000
  sessions spanning 10 simulated months. It measures 6 dimensions: recall
  by age, degradation curves, contradiction resolution, cost efficiency,
  cross-agent recall, and cold start recovery.
